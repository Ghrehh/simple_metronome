Metronome app made using wxpython, capable of producing irregular time signatures like 7/8 15/16 etc.
I'll eventually hopefully add a way to map out time signatures, for practicing those tricky riffs with awkward changes.

If you download the .exe you'll need the two sound files.
Only works on windows.
